Every now and then, we all like going on shopping sprees, only to discover that many of the items we buy may not actually be value. The strategic arrangement of various products by store executives may be one of the main causes of this. If that's the case, how can one avoid falling for such cunningly designed traps?, you might be asking.

### Introduction to the Python
The 2013 annual sales records for 1559 products across ten retailers in various cities are included in the BigMart sales forecast dataset. Due to the fact that the dataset has established unique characteristics of each product and retailer, such a large volume of data might shed light on insights into apparent customer preferences.


#### Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib, sklearn
